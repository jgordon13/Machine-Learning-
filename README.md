# Machine-Learning-
# the final project along with some independant research is displayed in this section from my machine learning class
# both of these projects were completed with in a Google Colab notebook so if there are any issued running my code please reach out
# 
# Final Project: 
# this project is an implementation of my learning and skills throughout an entire semester, my project wa to build a machine learning algorithm
# that would be able to take public data on individuals (height, weight, some medical history, ect)  and give an estimate to what there 
# insurance premium would be. This has been an ongoing projects even after graduation because I find it so interesting and I am hoping to get 
# the algorithms predictions as accurate as possible with time.
